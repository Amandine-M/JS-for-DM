# JS-for-DM
## To my students
**DM** is abbreviation for *"Développeurs/développeuses Multimédia"*

Here you can **find samples of possible corrections** (explained step by step during live sessions) which are different from what can be found on moodle.

Do not hesitate to **report bugs** following the Bug template that can be found in here.
Enjoy !
